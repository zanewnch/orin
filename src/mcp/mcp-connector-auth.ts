/**
 * One-shot `mcp-remote` spawn that drives the vendor OAuth flow. Credentials
 * land in `~/.mcp-auth`. We used to say "we never read that directory", and
 * {@link connectorsLackingOAuthToken} at the bottom of this file deliberately
 * reverses that: it is the only way to know a connector will open a browser
 * before the CLI spawns one. It reads presence, never contents. Injected spawn keeps
 * this testable without npx or a browser. A connector with `oauthScope`
 * writes that JSON to a temp `@file` (`writeOAuthClientMetadataFile`) because
 * Windows Connect uses `shell: true` and inline `{...}` is mangled; dispose
 * after the child exits. `session/new` gets the same flag from
 * `persistConnectorOAuthClientMetadata` so grok's later spawn agrees.
 *
 * A live Grok session already running the same endpoint holds the OAuth
 * callback port pinned in mcp-remote's client registration, and Windows skips
 * mcp-remote's lockfile so a second instance cannot learn the first exists.
 * That collision is REPORTED, never worked around — see
 * {@link authorizeMcpRemote} for why retrying on another port re-authorised
 * every host on the machine. `quoteSpawnArgs` wraps whitespace-bearing argv
 * entries only for this shell spawn — never in `mcpRemoteArgs`.

/**
 * A port conflict is REPORTED, never worked around.

 * This used to retry on a free port, and that retry is what made connectors
 * re-authorise whenever more than one host was open. The chain, measured
 * 2026-08-20/23:
 *
 *  1. The callback port is pinned by the OAuth registration — mcp-remote reads
 *     `client_info.json` and takes the port out of the registered
 *     `redirect_uris` (Linear: 22227). It is not ours to choose.
 *  2. mcp-remote's cross-instance lockfile coordination is disabled on
 *     Windows, so a second instance never learns the first exists.
 *  3. The holder is one of OUR OWN live proxies — grok's ACP session running
 *     the `mcpServers` entry we handed it. Already authorised, working.
 *
 * Handing mcp-remote a DIFFERENT port then means, by its own rule, "delete
 * `client_info.json` and re-register" — a brand-new OAuth client and a fresh
 * consent screen. Worse, `~/.mcp-auth` is shared by every host, so that
 * deletion invalidates the registration the OTHER windows were using, and they
 * re-authorise in turn. The retry did not recover from the conflict; it
 * converted a harmless collision into a machine-wide re-authorisation.
 *
 * So there is nothing to retry. A conflict means this connector is already
 * signed in and in use, which is the good case — the caller says so and stops.
