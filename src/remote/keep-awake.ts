// Keep-awake — hold an OS wake lock while work needs the machine awake: an AFK
// Pilot link (so an idle laptop doesn't drop the uplink mid-remote-turn) OR a
// local agent turn in flight (desktop / VS Code without a remote link). The
// opt-out key remains `grok.remote.keepAwake` (ships today); it now covers both
// triggers. Not "app is open" — a standing wake lock drains laptops.
//
// There is no cross-platform Node API for this and we don't want a native
// dependency, so each platform gets the wake lock its OS already ships:
//   macOS  `caffeinate -i -s`  (built in since 10.8 — the IOPMAssertion behind
//                               Electron's powerSaveBlocker; NOT the third-party
//                               "Caffeine" app, nothing to install)
//   Windows PowerShell + SetThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS|ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED)
//   Linux  `systemd-inhibit --what=idle:sleep --mode=block`
//
// Each child also watches OUR pid and exits when the extension host dies, so a
// missed kill can't strand a wake lock on the user's machine.
//
// EVERY failure here is silent by design: a wake lock we couldn't take is a
// missing convenience, never a reason to interrupt the user. Nothing in this
// module throws to its caller, shows a notification, or retries in a loop — the
// worst case is one line in the Grok output channel and a machine that sleeps
// the way it did before the feature existed.
//
// The plan builders are pure; only KeepAwake spawns.
