/**
 * Project file access for remote (phone / browser) clients.
 *
 * ## Scope of this module
 *
 * Browse directories, open one file, read its contents, and — when the host
 * advertises `editProjectFiles` — save edits to an **existing** text file.
 * No create, delete, rename, mkdir, or bulk/large-file download. Those need
 * separate designs; do not grow them here by accident.
 *
 * ## Fence composition (do not invent a second root)
 *
 * 1. **Which root** — {@link repoScopeFor}: for a remote origin, that tab's
 *    selected repo cwd. Remote file access inherits the same per-tab cross-repo
 *    isolation as history / New session, instead of opening a second,
 *    differently-wrong boundary. A phone deliberately reaches *less* than the
 *    desktop panel (which roots at the whole workspace).
 * 2. **Which paths inside it** — {@link resolveTreePath} / {@link listTreeDir} /
 *    {@link readTreeFile} / {@link writeTreeFile}: refuses traversal, refuses
 *    outbound symlinks/junctions, re-resolves before use (TOCTOU). Same
 *    containment the desktop panel uses; pure and unit-tested there.
 *
 * ## Why save reuses writeTreeFile (do not fork a second write path)
 *
 * Desktop already owns the careful bits that matter more remotely than locally:
 * - **TreeFileStamp (mtime + size)** — "did this file change under me?"
 * - **expectedAbsPath** — "is this still the SAME file?" A tab left open on one
 *   project, saved after the active folder moved, resolved its relative path
 *   against the new root and wrote into another project's same-named file. The
 *   stamp alone caught the common case and then offered Overwrite, which
 *   completed the loss. Both guards are mandatory on the remote path.
 * - preserves line ending, BOM, trailing newline
 * - applies the same executable policy as opens
 *
 * Preview classification reuses {@link classifyFilePreview} (and its byte caps)
 * so remote and desktop never disagree on which extensions are text vs binary.
