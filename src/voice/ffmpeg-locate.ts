/**
 * Find ffmpeg, and when it cannot be found, say something the user can act on.
 *
 * Pure: every filesystem and environment fact is injected, so the interesting
 * cases are testable without a machine that happens to be configured that way.
 *
 * Three real failures motivated this, all observed rather than imagined:
 *
 *   • **A GUI-launched app has a stripped PATH.** VS Code resolves the login
 *     shell's environment on macOS, so an extension host sees `/opt/homebrew/bin`
 *     and `spawn("ffmpeg")` works. Grok Build Desktop does not, so the same code
 *     reported ffmpeg missing on a machine where `which ffmpeg` answered fine.
 *   • **`brew info` prints the Cellar directory**, and pasting that produced
 *     `spawn /opt/homebrew/Cellar/ffmpeg EACCES` — macOS refusing to execute a
 *     folder. The error echoed the path back and left the user to spot that it
 *     was a directory.
 *   • **The remedy offered was "Open Settings"**, which is a dead end when the
 *     binary does not exist yet. It sends you to a text field to name a file you
 *     have not installed.
