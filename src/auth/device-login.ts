/**
 * Device-code sign-in — the pure half.
 *
 * `runGrokLogin` has always opened an interactive terminal on the desk. That is
 * the right thing on a desk (the CLI opens the browser for you) and it is why
 * the capability was `host-local`: a phone can neither see that terminal nor
 * type into it, and opening one on someone's machine from elsewhere is not
 * something a remote should be able to do.
 *
 * The CLIs have since grown headless flows that print a URL and a short code
 * and then poll. That is the whole flow a phone needs — display two strings,
 * wait. So the remote path runs the CLI with pipes and renders what it printed
 * into the transcript, and the desk path is untouched.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, because two of the three surprised us:
 *
 *   grok 1.0.5    `grok login --device-auth`   works on pipes. Prints the URL
 *                 and the code to STDERR (not stdout), keeps polling, exits 0
 *                 when the browser approves. Device-code: we display, it polls.
 *   claude 2.1.251 `claude auth login`         works on a plain pipe — no pty.
 *                 Prints one URL (paste-code `redirect_uri` on
 *                 platform.claude.com) and waits on stdin for the code the
 *                 person copies from Anthropic's page. `claude setup-token`
 *                 is a different command (an Ink TUI); it is not this flow.
 *                 Success is `claude auth status` → `{ loggedIn: true }`.
 *   codex 0.149.0 `codex login --device-auth`  the flag does not exist in this
 *                 build. OpenAI documents it, and it is additionally gated on
 *                 an account setting ("Allow device code login") that a
 *                 workspace admin can withhold.
 *
 * So this module does NOT hardcode "grok works, the others don't". It asks the
 * CLI and believes the answer: {@link deviceLoginPlan} says which command to
 * try and whether the person must paste a code back, the runner tries it, and
 * {@link classifyDeviceLoginFailure} turns whatever came back into something a
 * person can act on. Capability detection, never version numbers.
