# `grok agent stdio` Windows regression — stdin not read until EOF (issue #22)

**Status: FIXED** — the fix landed in Grok CLI **0.2.71** and is now on the **stable**
channel as **0.2.72** (verified 2026-06-28). The regression spanned **0.2.61–0.2.70**:
0.2.61–0.2.64 hung at `initialize`; 0.2.67/0.2.69/0.2.70 answered `initialize` but hung at
the *next* request (`session/new`). 0.2.71 (and 0.2.72) answer `session/new` with stdin
held open and pass the full live ACP gate (handshake, prompt round-trip, session restore,
plan-mode, subagent). Last pre-fix working build was **0.2.60**. **Windows-only** — macOS
ran the broken builds fine (see § macOS is not affected). **v1.4.18** adopted 0.2.72
as that release's supported build; the current `GROK_STDIO_DOWNGRADE_TARGET` and
`GROK_REQUIRED_VERSION` are **0.2.117**. The extension pins only the bounded broken
range **0.2.61–0.2.70** up to the current recovery target before spawning, keeps the
reactive startup-failure net, and disables Plan fail-closed whenever the installed
CLI is below 0.2.117 or its version cannot be read. Agent and Auto accept remain usable.
Tracked in extension issue [#22](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/22).

## 0.2.67 does NOT fix it — the hang moved to `session/new` (2026-06-26)

A first pass looked like a fix: the stdin-open `initialize` probe
([stdio-eof-mac-probe.cjs](stdio-eof-mac-probe.cjs)) answered in ~200–600ms, 5/5 runs on
0.2.67, where 0.2.61–0.2.64 hung. **But that probe only tests `initialize`.** A real
client sends `session/new` next — and the live suite + a controlled probe show 0.2.67
hangs there instead:

```
✅ initialize answered @283ms (stdin open)
→ sending session/new (stdin stays OPEN)…
… session/new still unanswered @8010ms → CLOSING stdin (EOF) to test the bug
   …notification _x.ai/settings/update @8400ms          ← only flushed AFTER EOF
❌ exited code=0 @10590ms  (session/new never answered)
```

The instant stdin is closed (EOF), grok flushes its queued notifications and exits —
classic EOF-gated read, identical to the original bug, just **one message later**. So
0.2.67 reads the *first* stdin line (`initialize`) immediately but still blocks every
*subsequent* line on EOF. `npm run test:live` against 0.2.67 confirms it: `handshake`
PASS, then `prompt-roundtrip` / `session-restore` / `plan-mode` / `image-gen` /
`subagent` all FAIL with `timeout … session/new`.

**Lesson:** verify a claimed fix with the **`session/new` probe**
([stdio-eof-sessionnew-probe.cjs](stdio-eof-sessionnew-probe.cjs) — sends `initialize`
*then* `session/new` with stdin held open), not just `initialize` — otherwise the moved
bug reads as fixed.

Extension change (v1.4.15): keep pinning Windows to **0.2.60**
(`GROK_STDIO_DOWNGRADE_TARGET`, unchanged); `isStdioBrokenGrokVersion` extends to
**0.2.61–0.2.67**; the reactive trigger broadens from `initialize` only to
`initialize` / `session/new` / `session/load`, so a future still-broken build
self-heals regardless of which startup request hangs.

### Note: `grok update --version` needs an unlocked binary

Downgrading from a broken build fails if any grok process holds `grok.exe` open:
`Auto-update failed: cannot rename locked executable … Access is denied (os error 5)`.
Close all running grok sessions (the VS Code extension tears its pool down before
updating for exactly this reason) and retry.

## Symptom

On Grok CLI **0.2.61–0.2.64** on **Windows**, the extension can't start a session:

```
spawning C:\Users\<user>\.grok\bin\grok.exe agent --reasoning-effort xhigh stdio (cwd=…)
grok exited with code null
Failed to start Grok: ACP request timed out: initialize
```

Downgrading to **0.2.60** (`grok update --version 0.2.60`) fixes it immediately.

## Root cause

`grok agent stdio` **does not read its first line of stdin until stdin reaches
EOF.** A live ACP client must keep stdin open (the protocol is bidirectional
JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout — exactly as the grok README's own stdio examples show,
with `stdin.write(...)` + `drain()` and the pipe held open). So the `initialize`
request is never read, the handshake times out after 120s, and the host tears the
process down — which surfaces as `exit code null` (SIGTERM), matching the report.

This contradicts grok's own documented stdio transport contract (README §
"stdio Transport"), where the agent is expected to process newline-delimited
JSON-RPC messages as they arrive.

## Reproduction (Windows, Node)

Spawn `grok agent stdio` the way any ACP client does — pipes for stdin/stdout,
stdin held open — then send `initialize`:

| Variant | stdin after writing `initialize` | Result |
|---|---|---|
| A | left **open** (real client behavior) | no response; `initialize` never read; on teardown `exit code=null sig=SIGTERM` |
| B | **closed** (`stdin.end()`) right after the write | full `initialize` response, clean `exit code=0` |
| C | left open, then 16 KB of padding written | no response (rules out fixed-size read buffering) |
| D | `shell:true`, extra newlines, a 2nd request | no response |

Only **EOF** unblocks the read. Padding to 16 KB does not, so it's not a
fixed-buffer-fill issue — the read is gated on stream close.

### Decisive evidence — grok's own `--debug-file`

With stdin **open** (failing), grok's debug log boots fully but stops at:

```
… Relay sync: DISABLED (not in TUI mode)
```

…and never reads the request. With stdin **closed** (working), the same log
continues *past* that point:

```
… Relay sync: DISABLED (not in TUI mode)
… plugins::discovery: plugin discovered …
… mvp_agent: code-nav capability initialized from initialize request …   ← the request was finally read
… session::storage::search: session search bootstrap complete …
… timing name="startup.stdio_agent_total" …
```

So the agent is fully initialized and merely **blocked on the stdin read** until
the stream closes.

## Ruled out

- **Arguments** — `grok agent --reasoning-effort xhigh stdio` parses fine on 0.2.64
  (`--help` confirms the flag and the `stdio` subcommand are unchanged).
- **Leader process** (new in this line) — debug log shows
  `leader mode resolved use_leader=false`; no `agent.exe` child is spawned.
- **Working directory** (C: vs the reporter's D: drive) — fails identically from C:.
- **Shell wrapping** (`shell:true`) — no change.

The reason a quick `printf '…' | grok agent stdio` *looks* fine from a shell is that
the pipe closes after the line (EOF), which is the one thing that unblocks the read.
Any persistent client hangs.

## Extension mitigation (shipped)

The current recovery target and native-plan floor are **0.2.117**
(`GROK_STDIO_DOWNGRADE_TARGET === GROK_REQUIRED_VERSION`). Before spawning, the
extension reads `grok --version`; if a Windows build is in the bounded broken range
**0.2.61–0.2.70** (`isStdioBrokenGrokVersion`,
[src/providers/shared/cli-locator.ts](../src/providers/shared/cli-locator.ts)), `maybePinBrokenCli` runs
`grok update --version 0.2.117`, moving it past the stdin regression. Windows updates
are no longer paused, and `shouldReactivelyDowngrade` remains the observed-failure
backstop at `initialize` or `session/new` when proactive recovery could not run.

Version verification now has a second, independent safety role: a CLI below
`GROK_REQUIRED_VERSION`, or one whose version cannot be read and has no matching
cache, may still run Agent and Auto accept but receives `planModeAvailable:false`.
A parseable below-floor CLI latches that off for the session; an unreadable probe
retries once, then uses `grok.cliVersionCache` when the binary identity still matches,
and otherwise stays re-checkable on the next Plan pick
(`resolvePlanModeAvailability` / `recheckPlanModeAvailability`).
Forged Plan requests against a verified-old CLI are rejected, restored/agent-initiated
Plan is forced back to Agent, and a stray `exit_plan_mode` receives an error instead of
an unsafe native verdict.

## macOS is not affected (verified 2026-06-25)

Ran the identical stdin-open `initialize` probe on **macOS (Apple Silicon)** against
the broken build to check whether the regression is platform-specific:

- **grok 0.2.64** (the same build that hangs on Windows): `initialize` answered in
  **~450 ms with stdin held open**, **4/4 runs**.
- **grok 0.1.216**: answered in ~520 ms with stdin open.

The EOF-gated-first-read hang **does not reproduce on macOS** — the bug is
**Windows-only**. This confirms the stdin-regression workaround's `win32` gate is correct:
`isStdioBrokenGrokVersion` / `grokUpdatePolicy` (`src/providers/shared/cli-locator.ts`) early-return to
a no-op on every non-win32 platform, so the regression auto-pin never fires off Windows.
The separate `GROK_REQUIRED_VERSION` Plan-availability check applies on every platform.
Widen/remove only the regression gate if the EOF bug is later observed elsewhere.

Probe: `research/stdio-eof-mac-probe.cjs` (keeps stdin open, asserts an `initialize`
response — the exact condition that hangs on Windows).

**Follow-up sent to xAI (2026-06-25):** submitted via the Grok CLI `/feedback` command,
noting that the regression first reported on Windows is confirmed Windows-only and that
macOS (0.2.64 and 0.1.216) answers the ACP handshake normally. Grok acked
("Thanks for the feedback! The Grok Build team is on it.").
