/**
 * The desktop log file.
 *
 * This exists because its absence was a bug that cost two crash reports. The
 * app wrote to stdout, which is discarded when it is launched from an icon;
 * "Show logs" was a no-op; DevTools is off when packaged. A reporter went
 * looking for a log, found a button that did nothing, and said so — which was
 * the only correct thing anyone could have reported.
 *
 * So the properties pinned here are the ones that decide whether a person in
 * trouble can send you anything: the lines are on disk, they survive, the file
 * cannot grow without bound, and none of it can take the app down.
