/**
 * What the host does differently when it is hosted.
 *
 * Three decisions, and each is one line of code that is easy to lose in a
 * refactor and impossible to notice afterwards:
 *
 *  - a cloud environment reports itself as one, and says NOTHING about the box
 *    underneath;
 *  - it reduces its whole routine schedule to a single timestamp, so the relay
 *    can wake it without ever learning what is due;
 *  - "am I hosted" is read from one variable and never inferred from something
 *    adjacent.
