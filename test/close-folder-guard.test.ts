/**
 * Closing a project folder is a revocation: every session it owns is disposed
 * and its agent process killed (a hard kill on Windows). "Close Project Folder"
 * is a File-menu item that gives no hint anything is running, so before this
 * guard a click mid-turn discarded the work with no warning and no undo.
 *
 * Found by independent review as a PRE-EXISTING High; fixed rather than
 * deferred because the standing rule is that High findings get fixed whatever
 * their age.
