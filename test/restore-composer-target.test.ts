/**
 * A rewound message goes back to the surface that asked for it, and no other.
 *
 * `restoreComposer` APPENDS to whatever is already typed (media/chat.js case
 * "restoreComposer") — deliberately, because silently destroying a draft is the
 * bug Edit exists to fix. Sent through `emit` it reaches the focused desk
 * webview AND every remote holder of the session, so once rewind/edit became
 * reachable from a remote, a phone tapping Edit would paste its message on top
 * of an unsent draft at the computer and steal focus there. Nobody at that desk
 * asked for it, and appending text to someone's draft is the "duplicating the
 * user's work" case the usage model rules out.
 *
 * Found by the independent review of the widening, and the same narrowing fixes
 * the desk-to-phone mirror, which was always possible.
 *
 * A source-shape guard, and honest about it: it proves the rewind and edit
 * paths route through the requester-aware helper rather than the session-wide
 * emit, not that a frame reaches one client and not another.
