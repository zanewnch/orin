/**
 * What an untrusted REPOSITORY can do to you.
 *
 * The desktop app changes who opens the code: on one developer's machine every
 * repository is one they chose, and the interesting attacks need a hostile
 * renderer. Distributed to strangers, the repository itself becomes untrusted
 * input — and a repository is allowed to carry files that change how the agent
 * behaves before you have read a line of it.
 *
 * These are the three fixes that shipped for that, from the release-scoped
 * review on 2026-08-07.
