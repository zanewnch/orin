# Running in a cloud environment

A **cloud environment** is a machine AFK Pilot runs for you, rather than one you
own. The same host runs there as on your desk — this repository's code, the same
agent CLIs, the same projects and routines — reached from a phone or browser
through [the relay](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-remote).

This page is about what the *host* does differently when it is hosted. The
user-facing half lives in the relay repo's
[cloud environments](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-remote/blob/main/docs/cloud-environments.md).

> **Status: the host side is built and tested. Provisioning is not.** You cannot
> create one yet.

## How the host knows

One environment variable, read in one place:

```bash
GROK_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT=1
```

`isCloudEnvironment()` in [`src/remote/remote-frames.ts`](../src/remote/remote-frames.ts) is
the only reader. Deliberately not inferred from the platform or the relay URL —
both of those have other reasons to look cloud-shaped, and a host that guesses
wrong about what it is will guess wrong about what it may do.

## What changes

### It says what it is

The device picker shows a **cloud** kind with "(by afkpilot.com)", not "Desktop
app, Linux". Both of those are true and neither is any use: nobody installed a
desktop app, and the operating system of a machine you do not administer is not
information. See [Signing agents in](provider-login.md) for the same principle
applied to sign-in.

### It tells the relay when to wake up

A routine fires on a laptop because somebody opened the laptop. A hosted machine
has nobody to open it, so `nextWakeAt()` in [`src/routines.ts`](../src/routines.ts)
reduces the whole schedule to a single timestamp and posts it to
`/api/environment/wake-at` whenever the schedule changes.

**The relay is told when, never what.** Not the cadence, not the routine's name,
not the prompt — one number. Teaching the relay about routines would put
schedules in a database that deliberately holds no payloads.

`null` is a real value: pausing or deleting your last routine clears the standing
wake, or the machine starts up nightly for something that no longer exists.

Best-effort. A relay that is unreachable or older than the endpoint gets silence,
because a failure here **delays** a routine and never loses one — catch-up is
arithmetic, so a missed window still runs when the machine next comes up.

### Connectors are hidden

`mcpSettings` is withheld. Connecting an MCP connector is a browser OAuth flow at
the vendor, and a hosted machine has no browser — nor, unlike a desk, any
computer to walk over to.

This is the **one** host-local capability that does not re-home. The rest of them
— opening a file, a diff, a URL, settings — are all things the remote client can
do itself, because in a cloud environment it is the only client there is. That
one genuinely cannot: nobody can complete somebody else's OAuth on their behalf.

Hidden rather than shown-and-disabled: a control that explains why it will not
work is still a control that does not work.

### Signing in works; signing out is the interesting case

Connecting an agent uses the device-code flow that any remote client uses
(shipped 3.19.0 — see [Signing agents in](provider-login.md)). It has to work:
there is no desk to fall back to, so a cloud environment with nothing connected
could otherwise never be made usable.

Signing **out** is currently `host-local`, and that classification was reasoned
about a desk: revoking a credential affects every other surface using it. In a
cloud environment, that environment *is* the only surface, so the argument
inverts. Not yet changed, and recorded here because it is a real difference
rather than an oversight.

## What does not change

Everything else. The host is the same binary running the same code: chat,
sessions, projects, file browse and edit, worktrees, routines, permission
prompts and the capability policy all behave exactly as they do on a desk,
because none of them ever depended on who owned the machine.

Two things are worth knowing anyway:

- **`keep-awake.ts` is inert.** It holds an OS wake lock so an idle laptop does
  not drop the uplink; there is no lid to close in a container, and
  `systemd-inhibit` is unavailable. It fails silently, which is what that module
  does by design.
- **Your agent credentials live in the environment.** Sign-in completes there,
  against the vendor, and nothing transits the relay. That is required for Claude
  and good practice for the rest — a token that never moves cannot leak in
  transit — and it means the environment is a credential store.

## How a cloud machine gets this app

Not from an image. The hosted environments run on Fly Sprites, which hand you a
stock Ubuntu box with a writable overlay and offer no way to supply a base image
of your own — so a fresh machine has Node, git and a couple of agent CLIs, and
none of a display server, Chromium's libraries, or this app. It installs itself.

That install is why this repo publishes a **Linux AppImage** that no download
page offers. Building from source on one of these machines was measured at 25
minutes end to end — `apt` 58s, clone 77s, `npm ci` 20 minutes (I/O-bound on the
VM's writable overlay, which is pathological for `node_modules`), compile 4.6
minutes. Downloading a built artifact is seconds. The AppImage exists for
machines nobody can walk up to, and for nothing else; it is unsigned, because
there is nothing to sign it for.

The bootstrap script is served by the relay rather than baked in, and prefers the
published AppImage with a build-from-source fallback — so a release that is
missing one still produces working machines, slowly.

The relay keeps a pool of these built ahead of demand, so the 25 minutes is paid
where nobody is waiting. Someone waits for a real build only when the pool is
empty, and the picker says so with a clock rather than calling the machine
offline. The pool, the claim and the token handover are the relay's side; see
`docs/cloud-environments.md` in the relay repo.

## Running one yourself

`cloud/Dockerfile` in the relay repo is a **container** version of the same idea,
and it is a spike rather than what production runs — it predates the move to
Sprites and cannot be used as a sprite's base image. It is still the clearest
single statement of what a cloud machine needs: a Linux container with Node, git,
the agent CLIs and a display server, running this repo's desktop host under
`Xvfb` with `--no-sandbox`, given `GROK_RELAY_URL`, `GROK_RELAY_DEVICE_TOKEN` and
`GROK_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT=1`.

Two things that will bite anyone reproducing it, both fixed here but worth
knowing:

- The desktop app could not start on Linux unpackaged at all until `ebdc6b8` —
  `electron-updater` builds `AppImageUpdater` on first read of `autoUpdater`, and
  its constructor rejects the `"0.0"` version an unpackaged app reports.
- `xvfb-run` cannot authenticate Electron to its own X server in a container, and
  fails in the worst way: the node process vanishes while `xvfb-run` stays alive,
  so the container looks healthy and hosts nothing. Start `Xvfb` directly with
  `-ac`.
- `npm ci` can report success and still leave a broken Electron. The download in
  its postinstall failed silently on a sprite and the first sign of it was
  `Error: Electron failed to install correctly` twenty-five minutes later, at
  startup. Re-running `node node_modules/electron/install.js` afterwards is cheap
  and is the difference between a machine that works and one that boots into a
  stack trace.
