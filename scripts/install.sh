# Install the Grok VS Code extension on macOS / Linux / WSL.
# Usage:  ./scripts/install.sh [path/to/file.vsix] [cli] [--all] [--prod]
#   [cli]  — a code-compatible CLI name or path to install into (e.g. code-insiders,
#            cursor, antigravity-ide, /path/to/code); also settable via CODE_CLI=…
#            Default: auto-detect code → code-insiders → cursor → antigravity-ide → antigravity.
#   --all  — install into EVERY detected known CLI in one run (build once, install N times).
#   --prod — build against the PRODUCTION relay instead of the staging one.
# Picks the first .vsix in the repo root, or builds one if none exists.
# Args are classified by shape, so order doesn't matter: *.vsix → package, --all → all, else → cli.
#
# RELAY: this script exists only to put a build on THIS machine for testing, so
# it builds against the STAGING relay by default — the twin of install.ps1's
# behaviour. A published extension always runs in production mode, which is why
# the GROK_RELAY_URL override that serves the desktop app cannot help here: the
# constant in src/remote/remote-frames.ts has to be swapped for the build and swapped
# back afterwards.
#
# The swap-back runs from a trap, and the script then proves the staging URL is
# gone from the file. Forgetting to restore it by hand is how a staging URL
# reached the PUBLIC repo once already; that is the whole reason this is
# automated rather than written down. The staging URL itself is NOT in this
# file — it comes from the gitignored .env, because this repository is public.
#
# `npm run package` refuses a non-production REMOTE_RELAY_URL. This script sets
# GROK_ALLOW_STAGING_RELAY_VSIX to the required phrase for that one build only —
# a flag or a leftover `=1` will not pass.
