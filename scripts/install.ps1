# Install the Grok VS Code extension on Windows.
# Usage:  pwsh scripts\install.ps1 [-VsixPath path\to.vsix] [-Cli name-or-path] [-All] [-Prod]
#   -Cli  - a code-compatible CLI to install into (e.g. code-insiders, cursor,
#           antigravity, C:\path\to\code.cmd); also settable via $env:CODE_CLI.
#           Default: auto-detect code -> code-insiders -> cursor -> antigravity-ide -> antigravity.
#   -All  - install into EVERY detected known CLI in one run (build once, install N times).
#   -Prod - build against the PRODUCTION relay instead of the staging one.
#
# Always builds a FRESH .vsix from the current source (npm run package clears the
# stale one first) unless an explicit -VsixPath is given - so an install never
# silently ships a leftover build. Uses --force so a same-version reinstall overwrites.
#
# RELAY: this script exists only to put a build on THIS machine for testing, so
# it builds against the STAGING relay by default. A published extension always
# runs in production mode, which is why the GROK_RELAY_URL override that serves
# the desktop app cannot help here - the constant in src\remote\remote-frames.ts has to
# be swapped for the build and swapped back afterwards.
#
# The swap-back is in a finally block, and the script verifies the file is byte
# identical afterwards. Forgetting to restore it by hand is how a staging URL
# reached the PUBLIC repo once already; that is the whole reason this is
# automated rather than written down. The staging URL itself is NOT in this
# file - it comes from the gitignored .env, because this repository is public.
#
# `npm run package` now refuses a non-production REMOTE_RELAY_URL. This script
# sets GROK_ALLOW_STAGING_RELAY_VSIX to the required phrase for that one
# build only — a flag or a leftover `=1` will not pass.
