.SYNOPSIS
  One-command release for grok-build-vscode — encodes the standing
  "release push to main" procedure from CLAUDE.md so it doesn't have to be
  orchestrated by hand each time.

.DESCRIPTION
  Reads the version from package.json (bump it + write the changelog section
  FIRST — those stay user-initiated), then runs the gate and ships:

    1. assert on `main`
    2. tsc --noEmit + npm test       (skip all gating with -NoTest)
       + npm run test:integration    (real Extension Host; skip with -SkipIntegration)
       + npm run e2e:screens         (real Electron desktop; skip with -SkipScreens)
       + npm run test:live           (real grok — mandatory gate; skip with -SkipLive)
    3. assert tag vX.Y.Z is free     (bump the version if it isn't)
    4. npm run package               -> grok-vscode-phuryn-X.Y.Z.vsix
    5. commit the working tree        (message from -MessageFile / -Message / default)
    6. push main
    6b. wait for CI to go GREEN on the pushed SHA  (skip with -SkipCiWait,
        budget with -CiTimeoutMinutes) — before any tag exists
    7. annotated tag vX.Y.Z + push
    8. gh release create vX.Y.Z       with the changelog section as notes
                                       AND the .vsix attached as a release asset
    9. npm run publish:ovsx           publish that .vsix to Open VSX
   10. desktop installers             dispatch desktop-release.yml against the
                                       TAG, wait, and assert the .exe/.dmg are
                                       actually on the release (skip with
                                       -SkipInstallers)
   10. install.ps1 -VsixPath ... -All install the released .vsix into every
                                       detected local editor (skip with
                                       -NoInstall; never fails the release)

  Open VSX is part of the release. The VS Code Marketplace is deliberately NOT —
  that one is the owner's, a separate explicit step (`npm run publish`).

# This used to be a manual second dispatch, remembered from the playbook, and
# 3.2.9 shipped with only the .vsix because the FIRST dispatch had happened and
# read like the job was done. The owner's question on 2026-08-26 was the right
# one: a release should release everything. So the same argument the Open VSX
# step above makes applies here — part of the release, not a reminder printed
# after it.
#
# Two dispatches still exist and they are different things. The one BEFORE a
# release (no release_tag, any branch) builds the owner's test installers and
# creates nothing; that one stays manual because it is a testing choice. This is
# the other one, and it was never a choice.
#
# `--ref $tag`, not main: the installers must be built from exactly what was
# released, not from whatever landed on main in the meantime.
#
# Unconditional, rather than "only when src/desktop or media/chat.js changed".
# That judgement has been got wrong once already, the workflow prunes installers
# from all but the newest releases anyway, and a release whose assets are
# consistent is worth five minutes of CI.
#
# What is asserted is the OUTCOME — the assets on the release — not that a run
# was dispatched. `gh release view --json assets` is the check the playbook says
# a release is not finished without, so the script makes it rather than asking a
# human to remember to.
