/**
 * One-shot / rebuild helper: regenerate README.marketplace.md from README.md
 * by taking the extension-facing body and wrapping an extension-only header.
 * Run: node scripts/gen-marketplace-readme.cjs
 *
 * Packaging always uses --readme-path README.marketplace.md; this script is
 * only for regenerating content after large README edits.
 *
 * `buildMarketplaceReadme` is exported so the suite can assert the committed
 * file still matches what this produces. That check is the point: the listing
 * is generated, so a hand-edit to the output is silently destroyed the next
 * time anyone runs the script — which is how `## Companion apps` came to exist
 * only in the output file, and would have vanished on the next regeneration.

> **GUI for Grok Build CLI (incl. Grok 4.6)** — not affiliated with or endorsed by SpaceXAI (formerly xAI). *Grok*, *Grok Build*, and *xAI* are trademarks of xAI; this project uses those names only to describe what it's compatible with.

The GUI for **Grok Build CLI** (incl. **Grok 4.6**), right in your editor — with **Remote Control**: pair **[AFK Pilot](https://afkpilot.com)** once and watch, approve, and steer your agent from your phone or any browser while away from your desk. Drop open files in as \`@\`-context, run **multiple sessions** at once, keep **resumable chat history**, generate **images & video inline**, and dictate by **voice**. If you'd rather stay in VS Code than a terminal, this brings Grok Build's agent into your sidebar.

No manual setup: the extension **walks you through installing the \`grok\` CLI and signing in** — with a **SuperGrok or X Premium+ subscription**, or an **xAI API key** — right from the sidebar, one click per step.

## Why use this?

If you live in your editor, this puts Grok Build right next to your code — a graphical workflow on top of the CLI: the **native diff editor** on every proposed edit, your **open files and selection as context**, **parallel sessions** with status dots, **resumable history**, **inline images & video**, and **voice dictation**. The CLI does the heavy lifting; this is the GUI for when you'd rather not be in a terminal.

// Install + Quick start for the marketplace: extension only. README.md's own
// pair is dual-host, so it is sliced out of the body rather than shipped —
// see buildMarketplaceReadme. Deliberately does NOT link to the Marketplace or
// Open VSX the way README.md does: this page IS the store page.
const installBlock = `## Install

**1. Install the extension.** In VS Code or Cursor, open **Extensions** (\`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X\`) and search **"Grok Build for VS Code (Community)"**.

**2. Open Grok and sign in.** Press \`Ctrl/Cmd+;\`. The sidebar **walks you through installing the \`grok\` CLI and signing in** — one click per step, with your SuperGrok / X Premium+ subscription or an xAI API key. That's the whole setup.

Grok opens in the **Secondary Side Bar** (right side, next to other AI tools). Prefer it elsewhere? Gear → **Config & debug** → **Move view** relocates it to the Panel or Primary Side Bar in one click.

> Prefer the terminal, building from source, or installing into several IDEs at once? See the project [INSTALL docs](https://github.com/zanewnch/orin/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md).

---

## Quick start

1. **Open** the Grok view (\`Ctrl/Cmd+;\`, or **Grok: Open** from the command palette) — it lives in the Secondary Side Bar by default.
2. **Type a prompt** and press **Enter**. Grok streams its answer, showing a *Thinking…* line while it reasons. Want the full reasoning inline? Turn on **Show thinking traces** in the gear menu → *Config & debug*.
3. **Approve actions.** When Grok wants to write a file or run a command it may raise a permission card — preview an edit in the native **diff editor**, with full-file context focused on the first changed line, then *Allow once / always / Reject*.
4. **Pick your mode** (Agent / Plan / Auto accept), **model**, and **reasoning effort** from the bottom toolbar and gear menu.
5. **Resume anytime** — the clock icon lists past sessions for this project.

// The companions the listing may mention. The marketplace Install section is
// extension-only, so this is the one place a reader learns AFK Pilot and the
// desktop app exist. Generator-owned rather than carried from README.md,
// because README.md covers the same ground inside `## Install` — the section
// this file replaces wholesale.
const companionBlock = `## Companion apps

This extension is complete on its own. Two optional companions share the same
chat UI and the same Grok Build CLI:

- **[AFK Pilot](https://afkpilot.com)** — watch, approve, and steer this
  extension's agent from your phone or any browser. Pair once from the gear
  menu.
- **[Grok Build Desktop (Community)](https://afkpilot.com/desktop)** — the same
  agent as a standalone app for Windows and macOS, for machines where you would
  rather not install an editor. Free.

Neither is required, and nothing here depends on them.
